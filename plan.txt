=== THE GRAND PLAN ===

Let's see if I can get this to something

- Accounts
	- name, picture, bio, etc.
	- email
	- properties
		- tags that define interests("sporting", "programming", "painting")
		- badges that define the persons special properties("Director", "Founder")
		- should all be JSON

- If someone has an idea, it can just select a property and send it to all people with that
  property via email(or something).
	- Example: James wants to do a day of pizza baking, it just creates a message and
	  just sends it to all people with the tag "cooking"

- You can create events, and let people now based on properties
	- private, public

- Or you can just send messages, based on people or property

0  tags and badges, choose between tag and badge
	o A tag is something you like, like cooking
	o And a badge is something you "earn" or "am", like being a teacher or a student

- Table of users
	[]	id
	[]	json
		[] profile
			[] username
			[] name
			[] password(duh)	
			[] email
			[] picture_url
			[] bio
		[] properties
			(see property in table properties)
Imported as class User


- Table of properties
	[] id
	[] json
		[] users(id's)
		[] property - this is what gets saved on someone's profile
			[] type(tag or badge)
			[] id(optional)
			[] name
			[] description
			[] CSS (optional) - contents described here just stored in JSON, not in-sub object
				[] css - the css class, *contents* of css class
					o auto-generated classname, on page load? At least not static.
				[] cssadditional - additional dependencies (optional)
					o for animation or something, like a rainbow
					o should almost never be used
				[] cssclass
					o classname

- Table of events
	[] id
	[] json
		[] badge
		[] ???
 
Imported as class Property

TODO:
- Link properties and users
- Add "view" method to property, displays it on page
- CSS generation(one file)
