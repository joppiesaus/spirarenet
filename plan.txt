=== THE GRAND PLAN ===

- Accounts
	- name, picture, bio, etc.
	- email
	- properties
		- tags that define interests("sporting", "programming", "painting")
		- badges that define the persons special properties("Director", "Founder")
		- should all be JSON

- If someone has an idea, it can just select a property and send it to all people with that
  property via email(or something).
	- Example: James wants to do a day of pizza baking, it just creates a message and
	  just sends it to all people with the tag "cooking"

- You can create events, and let people now based on properties
	- private, public

- Or you can just send messages

- Table of users
	[]	id
	[]	json
		[] profile
			[] name
			[] password(duh)	
			[] email
			[] picture_url
			[] bio
		[] properties
			[] tags and badgeschoose between tag and badge
			[] tags
			[] badges

- Table of properties
	[] id
	[] json
		[] type(tag or badge)
		[] name
		[] description
		[] css url, css classname
		[] users(id's)
	

- Stored in a DB.
- PHP?
